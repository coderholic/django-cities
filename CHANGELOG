2012-06-25 1.9.4

    - Fixed south migration and PEP8.
    - Some code for 2.0 accidently was in the previous release.

2012-06-12 1.9.3

    Fixed contrib stuff.

2012-06-12 1.9.2

    Fixed region import for malta.

2012-06-10 1.9.1

    - Fixed chinese city name_ascii support
    - Fixed support for regions without names
    - to_search() now automatically called when filtering on
      search_names

    In 1.9.0, you had to query like::

        City.objects.filter(search_names__icontains=to_search('Paris, Fra'))

    In 1.9.1, passing the value through to_search() is automatic::

        City.objects.filter(search_names__icontains='Paris, Fra')

    Keep in mind that 'Paris, Fra' will be converted in 'parisfra',
    which is useable against search_names column.

2012-06-07 1.9.0 Added Regions/states

    - Run migrations: added Region, for USA state support because for example
      there is a city called "Greenville" in almost every state.
    - Remove CityAutocompleteWidget, in favor of a google-maps-like
      autocomplete channel, which you can use with the normal widget.
    - Update your querysets using search_names__icontains=some_value to do
      search_names__icontains=cities_light.models.to_ascii(some_value).
    - Run: ./manage.py cities_light --noinsert to update data, set
      search_names, alternate_names, region ...
    - If filtering cities to import with city_items_pre_import, make a matching
      signal reciever for region_items_pre_import new signal. For example::

            COUNTRIES = ('FR', 'US', 'BE', 'GB', 'ES', 'PT', 'DE', 'NL')

            def filter_city_import(sender, items, **kwargs):
                if items[8] not in COUNTRIES:
                    raise cities_light.InvalidItems()
            cities_light.signals.city_items_pre_import.connect(filter_city_import)

            def filter_region_import(sender, items, **kwargs):
                if items[0].split('.')[0] not in COUNTRIES:
                    raise cities_light.InvalidItems()
            cities_light.signals.region_items_pre_import.connect(filter_region_import)

    Also there is now a progress bar in the cities_light command.

    Note that the cities_light command now has very performant implementation
    of alternateNames parser, which opens possibilities:

    - it parses postal codes, but doesn't do anything with them yet
    - it parses the name of every country/region/city in any language, used
      only for search_names in this version

    For 2.0, we aim at:

    - including cities_light.contrib.postal_codes,
    - including po files with the translation for every country/region/city
      name

    Contributions are really welcome so please if you need any of these
    features don't hesitate to implement and do pull requests !

2012-05-24 1.3+ to 1.5.1

    We had to fix migration 0003 for mysql. So to upgrade from 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5
    to 1.5.1, do::

        ./manage.py migrate cities_light 0002
        pip install -U django-cities-light
        ./manage.py migrate cities_light


2012-05-19 1.0 to 1.1

    Backward compatibility breaks:
        - cities_light.widgets moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_widgets,

        - cities_light.lookups moved to
          cities_light.contrib.ajax_selects_lookups,

        - cities_light.autocomplete_light_registry moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_channels,

        - cities_light does not auto-register channels anymore (because you now
          have the choice between a basic channel and the remote channel.

    New features:

        - latitude and longitude fields,
        - search_names,
        - djangorestframework integration,
        - autocomplete_light+djangorestframework integration.
