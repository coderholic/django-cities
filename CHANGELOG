2012-06-07 1.9 Added Regions/states

    - Run migrations: added Region, for USA state support because for example
      there is a city called "Greenville" in almost every state.
    - Remove CityAutocompleteWidget, in favor of a google-maps-like
      autocomplete channel, which you can use with the normal widget.
    - Update your querysets using search_names__icontains=some_value to do
      search_names__icontains=cities_light.models.to_ascii(some_value).
    - Run: ./manage.py cities_light --noinsert to regenerate search_names.

    Note that the cities_light command now has very performant implementation
    of alternateNames parser, which opens possibilities:

    - it parses postal codes, but doesn't do anything with them yet
    - it parses the name of every country/region/city in any language, used
      only for search_names in this version

    For 2.0, we aim at:

    - including cities_light.contrib.postal_codes,
    - including po files with the translation for every country/region/city
      name

    Contributions are really welcome so please if you need any of these
    features don't hesitate to implement and do pull requests !

2012-05-24 1.3+ to 1.5.1

    We had to fix migration 0003 for mysql. So to upgrade from 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5
    to 1.5.1, do::

        ./manage.py migrate cities_light 0002
        pip install -U django-cities-light
        ./manage.py migrate cities_light


2012-05-19 1.0 to 1.1

    Backward compatibility breaks:
        - cities_light.widgets moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_widgets,

        - cities_light.lookups moved to
          cities_light.contrib.ajax_selects_lookups,

        - cities_light.autocomplete_light_registry moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_channels,

        - cities_light does not auto-register channels anymore (because you now
          have the choice between a basic channel and the remote channel.

    New features:

        - latitude and longitude fields,
        - search_names,
        - djangorestframework integration,
        - autocomplete_light+djangorestframework integration.
