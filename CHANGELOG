2012-05-24 1.3+ to 1.5.1

    We had to fix migration 0003 for mysql. So to upgrade from 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5
    to 1.5.1, do::

        ./manage.py migrate cities_light 0002
        pip install -U django-cities-light
        ./manage.py migrate cities_light


2012-05-19 1.0 to 1.1

    Backward compatibility breaks:
        - cities_light.widgets moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_widgets,

        - cities_light.lookups moved to
          cities_light.contrib.ajax_selects_lookups,

        - cities_light.autocomplete_light_registry moved to
          cities_light.contrib.autocomplete_light_channels,

        - cities_light does not auto-register channels anymore (because you now
          have the choice between a basic channel and the remote channel.

    New features:

        - latitude and longitude fields,
        - search_names,
        - djangorestframework integration,
        - autocomplete_light+djangorestframework integration.
